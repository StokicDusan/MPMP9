My solution for Matt Parker's Maths Puzzles no.9  

## Open part of the puzzle

Considering all the refections and rotacions of the starting triangle, we can represent
the starting three numbers such that

a ≤ a + b ≤ a + b + c,  
a, b, c ∈ Z.

Grouping starting numbers like this, iterating the procedure, the sum of numbers will
tend to

2 · GCF (b, c) ,

where GCF() gives the greatest common factor.
